Getting Started
---------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are unfamiliar with the WICED SDK, please refer to the 
WICED Quickstart Guide located here: <WICED-SDK>/Doc/WICED-QSG2xx-R.pdf
The WICED Quickstart Guide documents the process to setup a computer for
use with the WICED SDK, IDE and WICED Evaluation Board. 

The WICED SDK includes lots of sample applications in the <WICED-SDK>/Apps directory.
Applications included with the SDK are outlined below.
 Apps/demo : Demonstration Applications
   - Applications demonstrating how to integrate various WICED API features 
 Apps/snip : Application Snippets
   - Various applications to demonstrate usage of individual WICED APIs          
 Apps/test : Test & Utility Applications
   - console      : Provides various test features including Iperf for throughput testing 
   - mfg_test     : Manufacturing Test application to enable radio performance and certification testing
 Apps/waf  : WICED Application Framework
   - bootloader   : Bootloader application used in conjunction with the WICED Application Framework
   - ota_upgrade  : Over the Air Upgrade application
   - sflash_write : Serial flash library used to configure a serial flash for factory reset  
 Apps/wwd : Wiced Wi-Fi Driver Applications to demonstrate advanced usage of the low layer Wi-Fi driver
    
To obtain a complete list of build commands and options, enter the following text in the
base WICED SDK directory on a command line:
$> make

To compile, download and run the Wi-Fi scan application on the Broadcom BCM943362WCD4 evaluation platform, 
enter the following text on a command line (a period character is used to reference applications 
in sub-directories) :
$> make snip.scan-BCM943362WCD4 download run

Note : The RTOS, Network Stack & I/O bus components are now defined in a platform makefile in 
       the <WICED-SDK>/Wiced/Platform/<PLATFORM_NAME> directory. The default components may 
       be bypassed by specifying the component as part of the build string if desired.
       
Header files and reference information for supported platforms is available 
in the <WICED-SDK>/include/platforms directory.
Platform implementations are available in the <WICED-SDK>/Wiced/Platform directory.

   * BCM943362WCD2 Platform Restrictions
       The STM32F103 MCU on this platform only has 64kB RAM and 512kB Flash.
       Many applications that include more advanced networking features
       will NOT run on this platform! Either the application will not fit into
       Flash, or the application may run out of RAM at runtime and hang.
       Tips to use this platform:
         - Store the Wi-Fi firmware in external serial flash (or use the Wi-Fi 
           firmware inside the Factory Reset image in serial flash)
         - Do not use advanced networking features like TLS & mDNS      
         - Do not build applications using debug mode     
     
   * Wi-Fi Powersave (1)
       The WLAN chip requires an external 32kHz sleep clock input during powersave.
       Platforms that do not support Wi-Fi powersave (per the table above) are
       not capable of driving the WLAN sleep clock. An external 32kHz clock is 
       required for these platforms.
 
 * Wi-Fi Powersave Max. Sleep Time
   The WLAN firmware sleep time is limited to a maxium of 1 second. Attempts to 
   set the Wi-Fi listen interval longer than 1 second using the 
   wiced_wifi_set_listen_interval() function will be ignored. 
 
 * libc does not include support for printing uint64_t (long long)
   
 * RTOS detection may cause OpenOCD to crash in the following situation:
     GDB has an elf containing a known RTOS loaded, and your app is using the 
     RTOS memory for other purposes. This situation may occur while debugging 
     the bootloader
     SOLUTION : Remove " -rtos auto " from the <WICED-SDK>/Tools/OpenCD/OpenOCD 
                .cfg file that matches your hardware debugger 
                (ie. BCM9WCD1EVAL1.cfg for WICED Evaluation Boards) 

 * Support for IAR toolchain is available for STM32F2xx platform only (support for other platforms TBD)


Tools
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The GNU ARM toolchain is from Yagarto, http://yagarto.de

Programming and debugging is enabled by OpenOCD, http://openocd.berlios.de

The standard WICED Evaluation board (BCM9WCD1EVAL1) provides two physical 
programming/debug interfaces for the STM32 host microprocessor: USB-JTAG and direct 
JTAG. The WICED Evaluation board driver additionally provides a single USB-serial 
port for debug printing or UART console purposes.

The USB-JTAG interface is enabled by the libftdi/libusb open source driver,
http://intra2net.com/en/developer/libftdi. 
The direct JTAG interface works with third party JTAG programmers including 
Segger, IAR J-Link and Olimex ARM-USB-TINY series. OpenOCD works with the libftdi/libusb 
USB-JTAG driver shipped with the WICED SDK and commercially available JTAG drivers 
available from third party vendors.

Building, programming and debugging of applications is achieved using either a 
command line interface or the WICED IDE as described in the Quickstart Guide.

Instructions to use the IAR toolchain are provided in a README located in the 
following directory: <WICED-SDK>/Tools/IAR
